# IMAGE_NAME=""

# IMAGE_DIR: directory location for disk images
# IMAGE_DIR="/var/lib/snf-image"

# IMAGE_DEBUG: turn on debugging output for the scripts
# IMAGE_DEBUG=no

# VERSION_CHECK: Check if host and helper have the
# same version. This is usefull if snf-image-host is
# installed as debian package and not from source.
# VERSION_CHECK="no"

# HELPER_DIR: Directory hosting the helper files
# HELPER_DIR="/var/lib/snf-image/helper/"

# HELPER_CACHE_DIR: Directory hosting the helper cache files
# HELPER_CACHE_DIR="/var/cache/snf-image/helper/"

# HELPER_IMG: Path to the helper VM image
# HELPER_IMG="${HELPER_DIR}/image"

# HELPER_KERNEL: Path to the helper VM kernel
# HELPER_KERNEL="${HELPER_DIR}/kernel"

# HELPER_INITRD: Path to the helper VM initial ramdisk
# HELPER_INITRD="${HELPER_DIR}/initrd"

# HELPER_TIMOUT: Soft and hard timeout limits for helper instance.
# The helper instance will be terminated after a given time if it hasn't exited
# by itself. A TERM signal will be send if the instance is running after
# a HELPER_SOFT_TIMEOUT interval. A KILL signal will be sent, if the instance
# is still running after a HELPER_HARD_TIMEOUT interval since the initial
# signal was sent. The timeout values are integer numbers with an optional
# suffix: `s' for seconds (the default), `m' for minutes, `h' for hours or `d'
# for days.
# HELPER_SOFT_TIMEOUT="20"
# HELPER_HARD_TIMEOUT="5"

# HELPER_USER: For security reasons, it is recommended that the helper VM
# runs as an unprivileged user. KVM drops root privileges and runs as
# HELPER_USER imeddiately before starting execution of the helper VM.

# the rootfs of the helper image.

# input of this program.
# PROGRESS_MONITOR=""

# UNATTEND: This variables overwrites the unattend.xml file used when deploying
# a windows image. snf-image-helper will use its own unattend.xml file if this
# variable is empty. Please unless you really know what you are doing, leave
# this empty.
