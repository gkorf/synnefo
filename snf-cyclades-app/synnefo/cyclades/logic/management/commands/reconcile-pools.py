Check the consistency of pools of resources and fix them if possible.

This command checks that values that come from pools are not used more than
once. Also, it checks that are no stale reserved values in a pool by checking
that the reserved values are only the ones that are currently used.

The pools for the following resources are checked:
    * Pool of bridges
    * Pool of MAC prefixes
    * Pool of IPv4 addresses for each network"""
